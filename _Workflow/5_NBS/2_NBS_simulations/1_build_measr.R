# Prepare management inputs  ----------------------------------------------
# The defninition of managment releated NSWRMs requires to prepare a
# R data object which provides all scenarios in a list structure.
# To prepare the data all SWATfarmR projects which provide the management
# for management related NSWRMs must be available in the SWAT+ project folder.
# Be careful with other SWATfarmR projects which are not the status quo case
# or one of the scenarios. If these are included and do not fit the status quo
# this can trigger an error. But you can also specifically define the scenario
# farmR projects (as done below).

# The name of the status quo farmR project must be defined.
stat_quo_farmR <- 'statusquo'

# You can also specifically define the scenario farmR projects. If not all
# farmR projects in the project folder will be considered.
# The scenario farmR projects in the SWAT+ project folder must have the same
# name as the scenario is then called in the NSWRMs. Be careful to rename
# the .farm AND the .mgts objects in the project folder.

# The management preparation routine adjusts the dates of operations in the
# scenarios which are the same as in the status quo but were assigned different
# dates due to the random sampling in SWATfarmR. But only operations which are
# newly introduced in the scenarios should have different dates.
#
# If operations in the status quo and the scenarios should be treated as the
# same (so they are the same operation type), but they have different op_data1
# you can define synonyms, so that e.g. tillage operations with different
# tillage types are still treated as the same operation and the dates will be
# corrected in the scenario.
# syns <- tibble::tibble(status_quo = c('cultiv25', 'cultiv20'),
#                        scenario   = c('fldcul12', 'fldcul12'))

# managements cover the same time period.

# The following function might give an error if you have more than one land use
# class without management schedules

# solution 2: re-install the farmr using remotes::install_github("chrisschuerz/SWATfarmR/tree/dev_ms") and run farmr again
